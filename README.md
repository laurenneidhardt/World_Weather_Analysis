# World Weather Analysis #
The purpose of this respository is to use online API's to provide customers with a well organized and informative travel plan, based on weather parameters that they provide. Using these methods we are able to parse through thousands of records very quickly to provide customized results.  Based on the weather output, we are able to provide them with a map guide of an area that would be accessible and comfortable.
